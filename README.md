# AI tools for Java
This repo contains a bunch of AI tools for use with Java. It was written for an [IGGI][iggi] module at Goldsmiths University.

## Compiling the code
The code is a maven repository, so you can compile it into a jar using maven. When the code is on an acceptable qaulity, it will
also be published in a maven repository.

   git clone https://github.com/unitycoders/ai-tools.git
